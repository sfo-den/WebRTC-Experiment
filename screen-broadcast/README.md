## How Screen Broadcast Works?

Following 3 lines given access to media stream and everything else was same!

```javascript
chrome.tabCapture.capture({ audio: true, video: true }, function(stream) {
    // broadcastNow(stream);
});
```

In simple words, multi-peers and sockets are opened to make it work!
