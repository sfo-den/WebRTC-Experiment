#### Browser-to-Browser audio-only calls

It is one-to-one audio-sharing experiment. You'll be asked to allow access to microphone or audio input device to establish voice-only call between you and your friend.

Nothing special in this experiment!

This experiment is considered old! It was last updated in December 2012.
