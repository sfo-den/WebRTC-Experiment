In simple words, multi-peers and sockets are opened to make it work!

1. Group file-sharing capability
2. Private sharing rooms
3. Easily understand and interchangeable code (use it for free!)
4. Change only 3 lines to use your own socket.io implementation for signaling. Change maximum 30 lines to use your own algorithm to transfer/save files!
