Multi-screen sharing among multiple users; in multi-directions! 3. Audio and/or Video among multiple users; in multi-directions! MultiRTC supports many complex renegotiation scenarios so that you can open text chat, same like skype; then you can add/remove medias (audio/video/screen) any time in any direction!  MultiRTC currently targets maximum 8-users per conferencing room; however, it can setup about 256 connections. Demo app: https://www.webrtc-experiment.com:12034/",
