[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/rtcmulticonnection-v3.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/rtcmulticonnection-v3) [![downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/rtcmulticonnection-v3.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/rtcmulticonnection-v3) [![Build Status: Linux](https://travis-ci.org/muaz-khan/RTCMultiConnection.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/muaz-khan/RTCMultiConnection)

> v3 has its own built-in socket.io server. It has pubnub/firebase demos as well; however [reliable-signaler](https://github.com/muaz-khan/Reliable-Signaler/tree/master/rtcmulticonnection-client) or [socketio-over-nodejs](https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment/tree/master/socketio-over-nodejs) or similar codes can NOT be used with v3. Please use [`Signaling-Server.js`](https://github.com/muaz-khan/RTCMultiConnection/blob/master/Signaling-Server.js) instead.
>
> v3 can use XHR/XMPP/etc. signaling implementations as well. Please check [PubNubConnection.js](https://github.com/muaz-khan/RTCMultiConnection/blob/master/dev/PubNubConnection.js) to see how to configure it for 3rd party signaling implementations. You simply have to modify top few lines.
