## How Video Conferencing Works?

In simple words, multi-peers and sockets are opened to make it work!

1. Video Conferencing!
2. Group video sharing capability ( many-to-many )
3. Private conferences
4. Easily understandable code (use it free of cost!)
5. Change only 3-lines to use your own socket.io implementation!
